# Yes or No

My public first hand embarrassment @ [Yes Or No](https://www.himanshuc3.github.io/YesOrNo/).

Here's a template for impressing your better half and get public with her in style or just win her back. Extend this to create infinite cringe content on the web, because it was already the end after tiktok launched. 

In case you'd want to know whether it worked for me, I'll keep you guessing. Here's a few additions I didn't add but you can, in case you have too much time lying in your hands:
- ðŸŽ¸ Add outro to **Yes** (Kabhi Kabhi aditi zindagi) and **No** (Imran Khan - Bewafa).
- ðŸ‘• Make qr code for the deployed website and become a walking paytm machine
- ðŸ’˜ Use it for valentines
